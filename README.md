# Getting Started

This repo is to provide a template and framework that can be built upon. You can use it to generate the site you want from tools like Obsidian.md

I tried to leave enough breadcrumbs for developers to take the concept and run with it.

## Start Here

This explains my process, and is a blog written as I was solving the problem. It's more stream of thought and I hope it will show you the process of creation more than give you step by step instructions. Take it and build upon it.

## Installation

`npm install`

`npm run build || npm start`

## Folder Structure

## Why the dotFolder structure?

dot Files are automatically ignored by obsidian.md and have no affect on the performance. Learn more by [reading here](https://dwayneparton.github.io/journal/2023/02/05/wordpress-to-markdown/).
